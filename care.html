				<h4>What Is Performance Care?</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">Performance care is a soft tissue treatment to improve an athlete’s performance in his or her chosen sport. Difficult training regimens, repetitive motions (swimming, running, cycling, MMA,) and overworked muscles all place a great deal of stress on an athlete’s body.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-lg-12">
				<div class="col-sm-5 col-sm-offset-1">
					<h4>The Problem: Soft Tissue Damage</h4>
					<p class="careInfo">Repetitive motion, constant tension, and pressure often result in the inflammation and swelling of soft tissue. The body responds to this inflammation by laying down scar tissue (cross fibers across the tissue) in an attempt to stabilize the affected area.</p>
					<p class="careInfo">Even though physical training factors can be modified, the biomechanical restrictions that have been created in the athlete’s body are seldom addressed. These factors lead to future injuries and inhibit the athlete from reaching his or her full performance potential.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-sm-4 col-sm-offset-1">
					<h5>Scar Tissue: </h5>
					<ul class="listItems">
						<li>Restricts motion</li>
						<li>Reduces circulation</li>
						<li>Inhibits nerve function</li>
						<li>Causes ongoing friction and pressure</li>
						<li>Produces additional cross fibers and adhesions across inflamed soft tissues</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="col-lg-5 col-lg-offset-1">
					<h4>The Solution: Performance Care</h4>
					<p class="careInfo">Before treatment takes place, an extremely specific examination and diagnosis must be performed. It is important to look past the initial point of pain to identify other structures that are involved in the kinetic chain.</p>
					<p class="careInfo">Effective treatment of any soft tissue injury (ligaments, muscles, blood vessels, fascia and nerves) requires an alteration in tissue structure to break up the restrictive cross-fiber adhesions and restore normal function to the affected soft tissue areas.</p>

				<div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-1">
					<h5>This Process: </h5>

				<h4>What Is A Doctor of Chiropractic?</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">The proper title for a doctor of chiropractic is “doctor” as they are considered physicians under Medicare and in the overwhelming majority of states. The professional credentials abbreviation ” D.C.” means doctor of chiropractic. ACA also advocates in its Policies on Public Health that DCs may be referred to as (chiropractic) physicians as well.</p>
				<h4>Our Philosophy</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">As a profession, the primary belief is in natural and conservative methods of health care. Doctors of chiropractic have a deep respect for the human body’s ability to heal itself without the use of surgery or medication. These doctors devote careful attention to the biomechanics, structure and function of the spine, its effects on the musculoskeletal and neurological systems, and the role played by the proper function of these systems in the preservation and restoration of health. A Doctor of chiropractic is one who is involved in the treatment and prevention of disease, as well as the promotion of public health, and a wellness approach to patient healthcare.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Beginnings</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">The roots of chiropractic care can be traced all the way back to the beginning of recorded time. Writings from China and Greece dated 2700 BC and 1500 BC mention spinal manipulation and the maneuvering of the lower extremities to ease lower back pain. Hippocrates, the Greek physician who lived from 460 to 357 BC, also published texts detailing the importance of chiropractic care. In one of these he declares, “Get knowledge of the spine, for this is the requisite for many diseases”.</p>
				<p class="careInfo">In the United States, the practice of spinal manipulation began to gain momentum in the late nineteenth century. In 1895, Daniel David Palmer founded the chiropractic profession in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer was well-read in medical journals of his time and had great knowledge of the developments that were occurring throughout the world regarding anatomy and physiology. In 1897, Daniel David Palmer went on to begin the Palmer School of Chiropractic, which has continued to be one of the most prominent chiropractic colleges in the nation.</p>
				<p class="careInfo">Throughout the twentieth century, doctors of chiropractic gained legal recognition in all fifty states. A continuing recognition and respect for the chiropractic profession in the United States has led to growing support for chiropractic care all over the world. The research that has emerged from ”around the world” has yielded incredibly influential results that have changed, shaped and molded perceptions of chiropractic care. The report "Chiropractic in New Zealand" published in 1979 strongly supported the efficacy of chiropractic care and elicited medical cooperation in conjunction with chiropractic care. The 1993 Manga study published in Canada investigated the cost-efficiency of chiropractic care. Results of this study concluded that chiropractic care would save hundreds of millions of dollars annually with regard to work disability payments and direct health care costs.</p>
				<p class="careInfo">Doctors of chiropractic have become pioneers in the field of non-invasive care promoting science-based approaches to a variety of ailments. A continuing dedication to chiropractic research could lead to even more discoveries in preventing and combating maladies in future years.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Educational Overview</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">Doctors of chiropractic must complete four to five years at an accredited chiropractic college. The complete curriculum includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory and clinical experience. Approximately 555 hours are devoted to learning about adjustive techniques and spinal analysis in colleges of chiropractic. In medical schools, training to become proficient in manipulation is generally not required of, or offered to, students. The Council on Chiropractic Education requires that students have 90 hours of undergraduate courses with science as the focus.
				Those intending to become doctors of chiropractic must also pass the national board exam and all exams required by the state in which the individual wishes to practice. The individual must also meet all individual state licensing requirements in order to become a doctor of chiropractic.</p>
				<p class="careInfo">An individual studying to become a doctor of chiropractic receives an education in both the basic and clinical sciences and in related health subjects. The intention of the basic chiropractic curriculum is to provide an in-depth understanding of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease. The educational program includes training in the basic medical sciences, including anatomy with human dissection, physiology, and biochemistry. Thorough training is also obtained in differential diagnosis, radiology and therapeutic techniques. This means, a doctor of chiropractic can both diagnose and treat patients, which separates them from non-physician status providers, like physical therapists. According to the Council on Chiropractic Education DCs are trained as Primary care Providers.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>Scope of Practice</h4>
				<p class="careInfo">Doctors of chiropractic frequently treat individuals with neuromusculoskeletal complaints, such as headaches, joint pain, neck pain, low back pain and sciatica. Chiropractors also treat patients with osteoarthritis, spinal disk conditions, carpal tunnel syndrome, tendonitis, sprains, and strains. However, the scope of conditions that Doctors of chiropractic manage or provide care for is not limited to neuromusculoskeletal disorders. Chiropractors have the training to treat a variety of non-neuromusculoskeletal conditions such as: allergies, asthma, digestive disorders, otitis media (non-suppurative) and other disorders as new research is developed.</p>
